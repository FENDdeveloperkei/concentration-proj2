### Game Behavior

**Memory Game Logic:**
_The game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins when all cards are matched._

**Congratulations Popup:**
_When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. It should also tell the user how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating was._

**Restart Button:**
_A restart button allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating._

**Star Rating:**
_The game displays a star rating (from 1 to at least 3) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, it should display at least 3 stars. After some number of moves, it should change to a lower star rating. After a few more moves, it should change to a even lower star rating (down to 1)._

**Timer:**
_When the player starts a game, a displayed timer should also start. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops._

**Move Counter:**
_Game displays the current number of moves a user has made._

### Interface Design

**Styling:**
_Application uses [CSS](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/css.html) to style components for the game._

**Usability:**
_All application components are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.[Udacity's HTML Styling Guide](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/index.html)_

### Documentation

**README:**
_A README file is included detailing the game and all dependencies._

**Comments:**
_Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedure when necessary._
